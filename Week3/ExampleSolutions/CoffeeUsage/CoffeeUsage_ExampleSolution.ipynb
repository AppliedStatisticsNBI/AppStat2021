    "1. Assuming the error of 30 cups, do the numbers follow the hypothesis of constant use? Quantify this, and find out how large the error has to be, for this hypothesis to be credible.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Example solution 1_: For the range of 60 to 105 days, the probability that the numbers follow the hypothesis of constant use is 10%. Depending on where you put your significance threshold, this is probably not enough to discard the constant use hypothesis. When we change the estimated error to 40 cups, the probability of the null hypothesis increases to 27%.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Consider only the data from the first 100 days(*). Does taking into account Christmas vacations improve the above hypothesis? Can you actually fit the length of vacation? Try to rewrite the function \"func_coffee\", such that it includes an \"if\", dividing the function into two linear functions with the same slope, that has an interval with no usage (i.e. the Christmas vacation).\n",
    "\n",
    "_Example solution 2_: The new advanced function that takes the Christmas holiday into account definitely improves the fit, with a new p-value of 0.42 for an estimated error of 30 cups. The fit also yields an estimate for the vacation length: 15.8 +/- 1.7 days. Since we know the Christmas holiday is 2 school weeks and 3 weekends, this is an imporessively accurate estimate!\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The total number of cups of coffey ever brewed was 36716, after which the old coffey machine was decommissioned. From the above data, estimate when this happened (including error!). And when would you estimate that the coffey machine was commissioned originally?\n",
    "\n",
    "_Example solution 3_: See example above. This example uses a very simple fitting function, a straight line. You can probably do better! One way of obtaining easy estimates of the uncertainties is to define your fit function in terms of the parameters you want to obtain. In this case, the fit function takes x_start (the commissioning date of the coffee machine, in number of days before 4/11/2009) and x_end (the decommissioning date of the coffee machine, in days after 4/11/2009) as input parameters. Minuit will optimise these parameters and return immediately their corresponding uncertainties. Another option is to propagate the uncertainties of the parameters p0 and p1, if you use those for the fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach gives an estimate of November 2006 as the commissioning date, and April 2012 as decommissioning date, both with an uncertainty of around 100 days. This is a very rough estimate indeed, also taken into account the sparse amount of data points, and the true dates are not within the calculated uncertainties.\n",
