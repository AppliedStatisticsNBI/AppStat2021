    "# Principle of Maximum Likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python script for illustrating the principle of maximum likelihood and a likelihood fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "__This is both an exercise, but also an attempt to illustrate four things:__\n",
    "  1. How to make a (binned and unbinned) Likelihood function/fit.\n",
    "  2. The difference and a comparison between a Chi-square and a (binned) Likelihood.\n",
    "  3. The difference and a comparison between a binned and unbinned Likelihood.\n",
    "  4. What goes on behind the scenes in Minuit, when it is asked to fit something.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this respect, the exercise is more of an illustration rather than something to be used directly, which is why it is followed later by another exercise, where you can test if you have understood the differences, and how and when to apply which fit method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example uses 50 exponentially distributed random times, with the goal of finding the best estimate of the lifetime (data is generated with lifetime, tau = 1). Three estimates are considered:\n",
    "  1. Chi-square fit (chi2)\n",
    "  2. Binned Likelihood fit (bllh)\n",
    "  3. Unbinned Likelihood fit (ullh)\n",
    "\n",
    "The three methods are based on a scan of values for tau in the range [0.5, 2.0]. For each value of tau, the chi2, bllh, and ullh are calculated. In the two likelihood cases, it is actually -2*log(likelihood) which is calculated, which you should (by now) understand why.\n",
    " \n",
    "Note that the unbinned likelihood is in principle the \"optimal\" fit, but also the most difficult for several reasons (convergence, numerical problems, implementation, speed, etc.). However, all three methods/constructions essentially yield the same results, when there is enough statistics (i.e. errors are Gaussian), though the $\\chi^2$ also gives a fit quality.\n",
    " \n",
    "The problem is explicitly chosen to have only one fit parameter, such that simple 1D graphs can show what goes on. In this case, the analytical solution (simple mean) is actually prefered (see Barlow). Real world problems will almost surely be more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the exercise is mostly for illustration. In reality, one would hardly ever calculate and plot the Chi-square or Likelihood values, but rather do the minimization using an algorithm (Minuit) to do the hard work.\n",

    "## Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure that you understand how the likelihood is different from the ChiSquare,\n",
    "and how the binned likelihood is different from the unbinned. If you don't do it,\n",
    "this exercise, and much of the course and statistics in general will be a bit lost\n",
    "on you! :-)\n",
    "\n",
    "The binned likelihood resembels the ChiSquare a bit, only the evaluation in each bin\n",
    "is different, especially if the number of events in the bin is low, as the PDF\n",
    "considered (Poisson for the LLH, Gaussian for the ChiSquare) is then different.\n",
    "At high statistics, they give the same result, but the ChiSquare fit quality can be evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unbinned likelihood uses each single event, and is thus different at its core.\n",
    "This can make a difference, if there are only few events and/or if each event has\n",
    "several attributes, which can't be summarized in a simple histogram with bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion:\n",
    "Fitting \"manually\" is damn hard, cumbersome, and not a thing that one wants to do. Always let a well tested program (e.g. iMinuit) do it, and instead take the inspired position of checking that the fitting program actually is doing what it is supposed to do, and that everything comes out reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The art of fitting is multiple. **Very importantly, a fit requires good input parameters**, as it will otherwise not converge. Also, the Chi-square fit is more robust, so it is often a good idea to start with this, and if the fit converges, one can use the fitting parameters as input values for subsequent (likelihood) fits. Finally, one needs to consider the binning and fitting range carefully, and make good use of the p-value from the Chi-square.\n",

    "\n",
    "# Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Consider the four plots (bottom right one empty) showing chi2, bllh, and ullh as a function of lifetime, tau. Do the four curves resemble each other in shape? Are they identical in shape? Do the three methods give similar results, or are they different? Do you see the relation between the curves and the fit result? This question requires that you also fit a parabola to the other two cases. Remember to consider both central value and uncertainty of tau.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Now consider the two (chi2 and bllh) fits by iMinuit. How alike results do they obtain? Again, consider both the central values and the uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Try to decrease the number of exponential numbers you consider to say 10, and see how things change. Does the difference between Chi2, bllh, and ullh get bigger or not?\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Try to increase the number of exponential numbers you consider to say 10000, and see what happens to the difference between Chi2 and BLLH? Also, does the errors become more symetric? Perhaps you will need to consider a shorter range of the fit around the mimimal value, and have to also increase the number of points you calculate the chi2/bllh/ullh (or decrease the range you search!), and possibly change the ranges of your plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Make (perhaps in a new program) a loop over the production of random data,\n",
    "   and try to see, if you can print (or plot) the Chi2 and BLLH results for each\n",
    "   turn. Can you spot any general trends? I.e. is the Chi2 uncertainty always\n",
    "   lower or higher than the (B/U)LLH? And are any of the estimators biased?\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Make a copy of the program and put in a different PDF (i.e. not the exponential).\n",
    "   Run it, and see if the errors are still asymetric. For the function, try either\n",
    "   e.g. a Polynomial or a Gaussian."
